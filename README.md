# Weight Tracker - Firebase

This is a clone of the original weight tracker app which was built on Hive NoSQL DB.

In this app, instead of Hive, I am using Firebase as backend.

## LOG

### 28-12-2020:

After going through the official docs, I was able to implement firestore as the backend for this app. Even though everything still looks the same, the backend is firebase now. Next planned update is to implement google sign in, so that each user can have their own separate tracker. 

## ToDo

* Implement Google sign in
* Update the sidebar to include the logged in user details
* Add more features like BMI calculator etc(by using 3rd party API's)
